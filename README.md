 Data and results for SCRUF experiments
 
 ### TO DO
 1. Entropy Calculation

### Questions
 1. Is entropy the compatability between the users and the features?
 2. Does higher entropy mean more dispersed scores? What does that mean in terms of compatability
 3. The ratings in the kiva data has a rating of 3 to 5, how will that impact the compatability?
 4. How do we decide if a feature ID is protected?
